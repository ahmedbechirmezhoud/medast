## Machine Learning 

The ischematic heart disease diagnosis system is made by finetuning 4 different algorithms (logistic regression, SVM, Random Forest and K-Neirest Neighbors) and training 40 models on 10 folds from the UCI Cleveland dataset and then stacking the 40 models with a Logistic Regression model.
